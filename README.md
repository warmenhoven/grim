grim is an IM client I wrote in an extreme hurry.
Later I added stupid features that I found were occasionally useful.
It "is more of a suggestion than a working client."
Requires ncurses, [libfaim](http://www.zigamorph.net/libfaim), and [libnbio](http://www.zigamorph.net/libnbio).
Even later I added Jabber support! (Why? I don't know!) Jabber support depends on expat.
